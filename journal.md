Note that finding this idea involved going separately and actually seeing the derivatives 
being computed from layer to layer. (what is happening).
I think this is how your mind works. You need to actually go and see what is going on.


# thm: Any subset $S \subset \mathbb{N}$ has a smallest element.
# pf: 
Our subset needs to be non-empty or the problem will be trivial.
Take any element from the list. Call it n. (Axiom of Choice)
Now of the finite number of numbers less or equal to n find one that is smallest.
