# tpc: Coding Design
	* Always do things the proper way
	* Choose readability and design over efficiency but try to do both
	* Choose a consistent format through a workflow and stick with it
		* It may be hard to choose a good format but it will be worth it
		* It may be dependent on what can i change or what can i not change?
	* When developing something, develop incrementally and test and be sure about the test
	* Take breaks please. Its a waste of time to go back and redo your mistakes that you made because
	  you were tired
	* Alot time to learn new things and improve on what you have
	* Take a visual look at the different methods available as well as the best ones
		* Survey vs Specialization (Width, Depth) 2dim

# tpc:
	* principal component analysis
		* https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dfg/ProbabilisticInference/old_IDAPILecture14.pdf
	* Variance - spread of data from mean
	* Covariance - measure of how two random variables will 
	  change when compared to each other
	*

# tpc:
* affine, euclidean space 
	* A group of points with actions (translation, rotation)
	* perspective transformation
* eigen values, taylor series (Harris corner detection estimate)

Note that finding this idea involved going separately and actually seeing the derivatives 
being computed from layer to layer. (what is happening).
I think this is how your mind works. You need to actually go and see what is going on.


# thm: Any subset $S \subset \mathbb{N}$ has a smallest element.
# pf: 
Our subset needs to be non-empty or the problem will be trivial.
Take any element from the list. Call it n. (Axiom of Choice)
Now of the finite number of numbers less or equal to n find one that is smallest.
