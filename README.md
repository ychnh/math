The purpose of journal.md is a general purpose notebook for me to write down ideas.
The goal is to move the contents of journal into appropriate categories.
I am not sure how the moving will be done.
I think I will treat each entry as like as a database entry with attributes
Need to figure out a good syntax and parsers.
